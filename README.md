# Digital-Image-Processing
Lets take a quick review on these files:

### HW0, Introduction to Python
random number,varible data type, function, Numpy, Matplotlib, image read and basic analysis, histogram.

### HW1, Basics of Digital image and basics of Operations
Minimum Distance between two points, Bilinear, bicubic interpolation, downsampling, bit plane slicing, normal noise distribution and averaging, Affine transformation, padding, forward and backward rotation. DICOM introduction. 

### HW2, Intensity operations
Histogram Equalization, Power Law, Bit plane slicing, contrast streching, costumized intensity transformation.

### HW3, Spatial Filtering
convolution, averaging, median filter with different kernels size, laplacian, Robert filters.

### HW4, Frequency domain processing 
Effect of different affine transforms on fourier transforms, frequency domain of image representation. frequency notch/ low pas/ high pass filter with different radius.

### HW5, Restoration and Morphological processing
Erosion, dilation, opening, closing, noise distribution extimation, Adaptive Local noise reduction, finding boundry, textural segmentation, granulometry.

### HW6, Segmentation and Registration
k-means clustring, joint histogram, region growing.
